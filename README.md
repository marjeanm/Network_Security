# Network Security: IDS/IPS Evaluation and Defense-in-Depth Strategy

This project presents a security evaluation and layered defense strategy for a fictional grocery store chain facing internal tampering threats. It includes a professional-grade recommendation report with cost-effective intrusion detection and prevention options, designed for real-world network protection.

---

## 📌 Project Summary

🛒 **Use Case**: Detect and prevent inventory tampering across multiple stores  
🔍 **Core Focus**: Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS), Intrusion Prevention Systems (IPS), Host-based and Network-based protections  
💡 **Strategy**: Defense-in-depth recommendation combining layered tools and staffing practices for continuous monitoring

---

## 🔐 Key Security Concepts Covered

### 🔎 Network-Based Intrusion Detection Systems (NIDS)

- **Splunk**: Cloud-based monitoring, alerting, and ML-powered detection  
- **Snort**: Free, open-source IDS with custom rule creation  
- **SolarWinds**: On-prem HIDS with log correlation (cost-effective alternative)

### 🛡️ Host-Based Intrusion Prevention Systems (HIPS)

- **Juniper Networks**: Active threat blocking on endpoints  
- **Microsoft Defender for Business**: POS-focused protection plans with automated investigation and response

## 🧠 Security Strategy: Defense-in-Depth

The proposed solution follows a **multi-layered approach**:

1. **Network Monitoring** – Detect anomalous traffic across sites  
2. **Host Protection** – Stop attacks at the endpoint level (POS & terminals)  
3. **Event Correlation** – Visual dashboards for analysts to review  
4. **Redundancy in Monitoring** – Two security specialists per store to maintain visibility and act as human firewalls

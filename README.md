# Grocery Store Security Evaluation and Recommendations

## Introduction

The purpose of this evaluation is to recommend a solution for mitigating potential tampering with inventory across several stores in your grocery chain. Incidents involving discrepancies in purchasing transactions and logging inventory changes have been identified. An analysis of your network has led to a proposed resolution aimed at enhancing your network security and preventing further tampering.

## Identified Security Issues

The ongoing incidents, involving tampering with inventory data across multiple stores, have highlighted significant vulnerabilities in your network infrastructure. After careful analysis, it is recommended that both an **Intrusion Detection System (IDS)** and an **Intrusion Prevention System (IPS)** be implemented as a first line of defense against these technical security issues.

## Recommendation

Given that your organization operates multiple stores with a centralized information network, a defense-in-depth strategy is advised. This approach, as described by the **Industrial Control Systems Cyber Emergency Response Team (2016)**, employs a multi-layered security strategy to protect all assets, interconnections, and dependencies, using available resources to provide effective monitoring and protection.

I recommend leveraging the two specialists available at each store to monitor the network, ensuring constant vigilance at both the network and host levels.

### Layered Security Approach

By adopting this layered security approach, you can set up alerts based on network intrusions and individual host prevention. This includes:

- **Network-based policies** to analyze and secure systems such as servers and devices accessing your network.
- **Host-based systems** to protect individual machines and secure encrypted data.

## Network Intrusion Detection Systems (NIDS)

### Splunk

Splunk offers a cloud-based platform for network intrusion detection. Key features include:

- **Data Collection & Ingestion:** Ingests data from various sources, including logs and events, at scale.
- **Data Search & Analysis:** Provides real-time and historical data search and analysis.
- **Monitoring & Alerting:** Monitors system health and generates alerts based on predefined conditions.
- **Dashboards & Visualization:** Allows users to create dashboards for easy data visualization.
- **Machine Learning:** Predicts and prevents potential issues.
- **Cloud-Based Services:** Scalable and flexible solution.
- **Security & Compliance:** Ensures regulatory compliance and robust data security.

### Host-Based Intrusion Prevention Systems (HIPS)

Combining **Splunk** with a **Host-based Intrusion Prevention System (HIPS)** such as **Juniper Networks** ensures comprehensive protection. Key features of HIPS:

- **Traffic Analysis:** Detects and prevents malicious traffic by comparing network activity with known threat signatures.
- **Active Intervention:** Unlike IDS, IPS actively intervenes to stop threats by blocking malicious traffic.

Splunk provides centralized control and minimal hardware requirements, making it an ideal solution for your stores. Although this solution may incur a higher cost, it offers granular control and flexibility.

## Cost Considerations

Considering your organization's focus on marketing over security tools, there are more cost-effective alternatives to Splunk and Juniper Networks.

### Alternative Options

- **Snort:** A free, open-source NIDS developed by Cisco. It operates in three modes:
  - Packet Sniffer
  - Packet Logger
  - Intrusion Detection
  
  Snort allows you to create or download custom rules, with plenty of educational resources available.

- **SolarWinds:** A low-cost HIDS solution, offering:
  - On-premises deployment for full control.
  - Event correlation and automated threat detection.
  - Comprehensive log collection and analysis.
  
  Despite its past incident with the Orion software, SolarWinds has improved security, and with store specialists monitoring the system, it can be a valuable tool.

- **Microsoft Defender for Business:** A low-cost endpoint protection solution for POS systems:
  - **Plan 1:** $3 per user/month (basic threat detection and response).
  - **Plan 2:** $5.20 per user/month (advanced threat detection, automated investigation, and response).

## Conclusion

By adopting a **defense-in-depth strategy**, involving both **network** and **host protection**, your grocery store chain can significantly enhance its security posture. A combination of IDS and IPS solutions, along with endpoint protection for each POS system, will allow for early detection of threats, prevent inventory tampering, and secure your organization's network from both internal and external threats.

This layered approach will reduce potential attack surfaces, making it easier to audit network activity, identify suspicious behavior, and respond to cybersecurity risks efficiently.
